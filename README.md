This project involved the design, configuration, and implementation of a robust and secure Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting two distinct companies, [Company A] and [Company B], each with two branch offices. The network aimed to facilitate seamless communication, resource sharing, and centralized management across all four sites, leveraging a shared Internet Service Provider (ISP) infrastructure.
